  <h1>iAIMS Code of Conduct</h1>

  <p>
    The iAIMS community grows strongest when people feel welcome, respected, and encouraged to share what they know. 
    These guidelines describe how we work together to build a supportive and inspiring space for advancing artificial intelligence 
    in multiple sclerosis research and care.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Be welcoming and considerate</h2>
  <p>
    Create an atmosphere where people feel comfortable joining the conversation. Recognize that members come from many backgrounds 
    and levels of experience, and approach interactions with patience and openness.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Communicate with respect</h2>
  <p>
    Engage in discussions thoughtfully and focus on ideas rather than individuals. Listen actively, ask clarifying questions, 
    and contribute in ways that help the conversation move forward.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Encourage participation from all disciplines</h2>
  <p>
    Make room for clinicians, researchers, engineers, statisticians, and others to share their perspectives. Support an environment 
    where everyone feels their expertise is valued.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Share knowledge responsibly</h2>
  <p>
    Present research, data, and clinical insights clearly and accurately. Be transparent about what is known, what is uncertain, 
    and what requires further work.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Protect privacy and confidentiality</h2>
  <p>
    Handle all discussions about data or clinical cases with care. Follow ethical and legal standards, and ensure that sensitive 
    or identifiable information is never shared.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Support open and fair collaboration</h2>
  <p>
    Contribute in ways that promote transparency, reproducibility, and equitable access. Acknowledge the work of others and respect 
    licenses, permissions, and community norms.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Foster a positive and inclusive environment</h2>
  <p>
    Help create a space where everyone feels safe and respected. Encourage curiosity, celebrate contributions, and model the kind 
    of collaboration you hope to receive in return.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Act with integrity</h2>
  <p>
    Be honest about your role, your work, and any potential conflicts of interest. Engage with the community in a spirit of shared 
    learning and collective progress.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Consider the impact of AI</h2>
  <p>
    Think carefully about how AI tools may affect clinical practice and people living with MS. Aim for approaches that are fair, 
    safe, and genuinely helpful.
